# Urban Heat Island Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

This GitHub Repo contains Jonah Zembower and Benjamin Nicholson's work from the EY Data Challenge 2025: Predicting Urban Heat Islands. 
We built a predictive machine learning model to identify Urban Heat Islands (UHI) using remote sensing and iterative Machine Learning pipelines.
Over the source of the project we leveraged a variety of satellite imagery, geospatial data, and machine learning models to accurately predict UHI values.

Our model achieved a final accuracy of 0.9606, ranking 86th globally out of over two thousand participants. ![Model Accuracy Ranking](images_readme/model_ranking.png)
